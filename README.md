# CS 493 Final Project
###### By Melissa Swearingen, Samson DeVol, Ian Snyder, and Jonas Boyer

In this course, a final programming project will take the place of formal exams to test your understanding of the material. The final project will involve working with a team of 3-4 people to implement a complete RESTful API for an application called Tarpaulin. You can find more details about Tarpaulin below. The API you implement will need to utilize most the components of a modern API that we talked about in class.

## Tarpaulin, a Canvas replacement

The application for which you’ll write an API for this project is Tarpaulin, a lightweight course management tool that’s an "alternative" to Canvas. In particular, Tarpaulin allows users (instructors and students) to see information about the courses they’re teaching/taking. It allows instructors to create assignments for their courses, and it allows students to submit solutions to those assignments.

The Tarpaulin API you implement must support all of the endpoints described in the Tarpaulin OpenAPI specification. Importantly, you are free to implement the endpoints described in the OpenAPI specification however you see fit. For example, you may use whatever database you want, and you may design your API architecture to meet your own needs.

The OpenAPI specification linked above will provide most of the details of the API you’ll implement, but some more details are included below.
